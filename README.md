Randomized Elements:
Big Dots: Placed randomly each time the game starts or is restarted.
Ghosts: Positions are randomized at the start of each game or when restarting.
Pac-Man: Starts at a random position in every new game or restart.
Multiple Maps: Three different maps are available, and a map is chosen randomly for each game.
Reset Keycode: A dedicated keycode allows players to reset the game at any time.
White Ghost Mode: A special mode where ghosts turn white, adding a new layer of challenge and strategy.
Straight Path Ghost Movement: Ghosts move in a straight line until they hit a wall, at which point they randomly choose a new direction.
